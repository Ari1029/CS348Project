## How to run the application:
To run the database-driven application, follow the steps below. The production database is on Neon and the application will automatically connect to the live server.
1. Open Docker Desktop, then run "docker compose up -d" from project's root directory.
2. In the client directory, run "npm install"
3. Visit "http://localhost:3000" in your web browser.

## Features
There are current three pages in the web client: "Home", "Drivers", and "Constructors" where you can find all six features using SQL queries, now working dynamically with the database for Milestone 2.
