# CS 348 Project: Formula 1 SQL
CS348 Web-based Application project by Aditya Keerthi, Aryan Sharma, Alex Zhu, Cheney Cai, Ryan Shen
Demo: https://youtu.be/uCIRlqrR-Gg

## How to run the application:
To run the database-driven application, follow the steps below. The production database is on Neon and the application will automatically connect to the live server.
1. Open Docker Desktop, then run `docker compose up -d` from project's root directory.
2. In the client directory, run "npm install"
3. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

**OR** just visit https://f1-sql.onrender.com/. (Note that it may take 50 seconds to spin up the backend if it hasn't been pinged recently).

## Features
There are current four pages in the web client: "Home",  "Rankings", "Drivers", and "Constructors" where you can find all six features + fancy features using SQL queries, now working dynamically with the database.
